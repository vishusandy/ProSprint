# Pro Sprint

## Overview

A modified version of [Greyscale's sprint plugin](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=567905) that adds a stamina bar and some natives to modify a player's stamina.

I have only tested this in Counter-Strike Source but it should work in CSGO.

## Natives
See [natives](natives.md)

## Suggested plugins

[ProXP](https://github.com/vishusandy/ProXP) can use this plugin to award extra stamina based on the player's level.

## Installation

See [Greyscale's sprint plugin](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=567905) for more information on installation and cvars.
