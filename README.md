# Pro Sprint

This is just a modified version of Greyscale's sprint plugin to add the ability to modify a player's stamina with natives.  I have only tested this in Counter-Strike Source but should work in CSGO.

## Overview

A sprint plugin that allows other plugins to modify how much stamina a player receives.

## Use Cases

[ProXP](https://github.com/vishusandy/ProXP) can use this plugin to award extra stamina based on the player's level.
